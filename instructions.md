## Python: If-Else Statements (Practice)

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **python-if-else-starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - **No need to share your repo with your teacher**
    - **Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time**

- Also create a NEW project folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to save your work (temporarily) to your workstation folder


### Comment Block

```python
# Abraham Lincoln
# 20 SEP 20XX
# Simple Math #2
```

### Coding Tasks

- Use comments to label each task in your script
  - Example: # Task 1, # Task 2, etc.
- Use f-strings to display the output for each task

#### Task 1

- Read **if-else Statements**, pp. 79 - 80 in the yellow PCC (*Python Crash Course*) book

#### Task 2

- Complete Exercise 5-4, **TRY IT YOURSELF**, p. 84 in PCC

#### Task 3

- Prompt the user to enter their first name
- Use the Python [`len()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) function and an if statement to determine if the number of characters in the name is less than or equal to 5
- If the condition evaluates to True, tell the user their name is too short
- Otherwise, tell the user s/he has a long name

#### Task 4

- Prompt the user to enter a letter of the alphabet
- Apply the `lower()` string method to the prompt (from Step 1 above)
- Using the `in` membership operator, write an if-else statement that checks whether the letter the user entered is a vowel 
- If the letter IS a vowel, tell the user that the letter is indeed a vowel
- Otherwise, tell the user the letter they entered is a consonant

#### Task 5

- Prompt the user to enter two (2) **integers**
- What function tells Python to treat user input as an integer?
- Using the modulus operator (%), write an if statement that checks to see if the first integer divided by the second integer has a remainder of zero (0)
- If the condition evaluates to `True`, print a message that says that the first number is divisible by the second number
- Otherwise, print a message informing the user that the first number is NOT divisible by the second number
